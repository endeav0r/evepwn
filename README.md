evepwn
======

A tool for analyzing market data in eve online. This plays in with the orderServer, another project of mine.

orderServer reads, stores and caches information from the emdr. This program queries the orderServer, gathering, sorting and displaying that information. orderServer and evepwn use msgpack and some other things to send tens of thousands of orders around in a mb or two.

I am releasing all of this code into the public domain.

All data is from static data dumps made publicly available by the creators of Eve Online, repackaged and more easily digestable. I have no rights over the data.
